  🎄 Merry-quitmas

The season of joy, reflection… and quitting halfway.

Merry-quitmas is a festive, chaotic, meme-powered website that roasts you for quitting on your goals — loudly, confidently, and with Christmas spirit.

Built for a vibe-coding hackathon where being useful was optional, but having a personality was mandatory.

🧠 What is Merry-quitmas?

Merry-quitmas is an interactive Christmas website that pretends to deeply analyze your life choices based on a few clicks — and then absolutely drags you for them.

You answer sarcastic questions about your year (or your excuses).
The website responds by:

Instantly judging you

Changing background colors based on your “emotional state”

Showing memes and looping videos that feel uncomfortably accurate

Escalating the roast the longer you stay

It starts playful, becomes unhinged, breaks the fourth wall repeatedly, and then unexpectedly softens at the end — because after all the jokes, you still made it through the year.

🎭 Personality & Tone

This project is:

😈 Sarcastic, but not cruel

🤡 Weird on purpose

🎄 Festive in the most unserious way

🧠 Self-aware about how ridiculous it is

The website knows it’s roasting you.
It also knows you’re enjoying it.

✨ Features

Nothing improves.

That’s the design.
